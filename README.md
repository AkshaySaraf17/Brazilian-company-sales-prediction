# Brazilian Company Sales Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing sales data for a Brazilian company using various data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning techniques. The goal is to gain insights into sales trends and build predictive models to forecast future sales.

## Project Structure

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- **Handling Missing Values**: Identification and treatment of missing data.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creation of new features, including date-based attributes such as month, day, and year.
- **Data Transformation**: Normalization or scaling of features to prepare for machine learning.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Summary statistics for numerical and categorical features.
- **Visualizations**: Graphical analysis of trends, seasonality, and outliers in sales data.

### 3. Machine Learning Models
- **Model Selection**: Training multiple regression models to predict sales.
  - Linear Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost)
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimization of model parameters to enhance performance.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Use of metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and R-squared to assess model accuracy.

## Technologies Used
- **Python Libraries**:
  - Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
  - NumPy: Numerical computing
  - Matplotlib/Seaborn: Data visualization
  - Scikit-learn: Machine learning
  - XGBoost: Advanced gradient boosting
